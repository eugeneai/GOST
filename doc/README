GOST is a bundle of BibTeX styles designed to meet State Standards (GOST)
on information, librarianship and publishing issued by Russian Federation
and interstate committee of former USSR States.

It may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the LaTeX
Project Public License, either version 1.3 of this license or (at your
option) any later version. The latest version of this license is in
   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
 version 2005/12/01 or later.

The System of Standards includes:
GOST 7.0.5-2008  Bibliographic reference.
                 General requirements and rules of making.
GOST 7.1  -2003  Bibliographic record.
                 Bibliographic description.
                 General requirements and rules.
GOST 7.80 -2000  Bibliographic record.
                 Heading. General requirements and rules.
GOST 7.11 -2004  Bibliographic description and references.
                 Rules for the abbreviation of words and word combinations
                 in foreign European languages
ect.

GOST comprises 8 BibTeX styles to format bibliography in English, Russian and
Ukrainian according to GOST 7.0.5-2008, GOST 7.1-2003, GOST 7.80-2000 and
GOST 7.11-2004. Both 8-bit and Unicode (UTF-8) versions of each BibTeX
style, in each case offering a choice of sorted and unsorted.

Further, a set of 4 styles (which do not conform to current
standards) are retained for backwards compatibility.
                                                                            
All BibTeX styles in the GOST bundle are derived from same \file{gost.dtx}
source by applying different set of options as shown in the table below.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 Style               | utf8 | moderm | eprint | longlist | sort
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 gost780             |      |        |        |          |
 gost780s            |      |        |        |          |   +
 gost2008            |      |   +    |        |          |
 gost2008e           |      |   +    |    +   |          |
 gost2008el          |      |   +    |    +   |     +    |
 gost2008s           |      |   +    |        |          |   +
 gost2008es          |      |   +    |    +   |          |   +
 gost2008els         |      |   +    |    +   |     +    |   +
 unicode-gost2008    |  +   |   +    |        |          |
 unicode-gost2008e   |  +   |   +    |    +   |          |
 unicode-gost2008s   |  +   |   +    |        |          |   +
 unicode-gost2008es  |  +   |   +    |    +   |          |   +
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 Style               | utf8 | moderm | eprint | longlist | sort
 ----------------------------------------------------------------  
 
Two styles gost780 and gost780s, compiled without |modern|
option, are retained for backward compatibility. They do not conform
the Standard 7.0.5-2008 cited above. 

If the number of authors exceeds 4, modern styles cut the list of authors
to at most 4 persons. Option |longlist| overrides this rule to
provide backward compatibility with the package disser developed by
Stanislab Kruchinin. Two styles, gost2008el and gost2008els,
compiled with the option |longlist| mimic behavior of the styles
gost705 and gost705s from the disser package. Major
effect of of the |longlist| option is that the list of authors always
precedes book or article title no matter how long is it.
Modem styles compiled without |longlist| place long list of authors behind
the title.

The |eprint| option enables experimental features on formatting
electronic publications. In particular, it enables |eprint|, |eprinttype|
and |eprintclass| fields for a bibliographic entry.

The |sort| option enables sorting bibliographic references by author names
and references titles. Finally, the |utf8| option produces bibliographic
styles in unicode rather that in 8-bit encodings. Recommended styles are
gost2008 and unicode-gost2008. They fit most needs.

Beyond that, GOST bundle contains CS files (codepage and sorting order).    
 
Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order
----------------------------------------------------------------
cp866           |   ruscii.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
cp1251          |   cp1251.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
koi8-u          |   koi8u.csf           Cyrillic first, Latin
utf8            |   utf8cyrillic.csf    Cyrillic first, Latin

In addition, BibTeX8 distribution comes with few more CSFs.

Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order

cp866           |   cp866rus.csf        Latin first, Cyrillic


How to use

1. Select bibliography style by adding appropriate \bibliographystyle
   declaration to your source file <filename>.tex, e.g.

	\bibliographystyle{gost2008}
	\bibliography{database}

2. Add the field language="ukrainian" or language="russian" to the
   bibliographic entries in Ukrainian or Russian languages in your
   database; English is the default language. German, Italian and
   French are partially supported.

3. To compile list of references from your database use bibtex8.exe
   rather than bibtex.exe. Depending on the codepage of your
   bibliographic database, indicate one of the CS files
   listed above as option to bibtex8.exe.  Run LaTeX, then run
   bibTeX8 and LaTeX again:

   	latex <filename>.tex
   	bibtex8 -B -c <csf_file>.csf <filename>.aux
	latex <filename>.tex

4. For details on preparing bibliographic database see
   examples in gost*.pdf.

5. Unicode-gost*.bst styles are primarily intended for use
   with unicode compilers (xelatex and lualatex). They
   should be preferred as well when using 8bit compilers
   (latex and pdflatex) if source file is in utf8 encoding.
   
6. Note that neither bitex.exe nor bitex8.exe provides
   correct sorting order of unicode text. It means that using
   unicode-gost2008s or any other style ended with `s' in
   its name may produce unexpected result for documents in
   utf8 encoding.


Customization

Every GOST style defines few commands to format some parts of a
reference. You can redefine these commands prior to
the \bibliography{<bibtex_style>} command. Initial
definitions are listed below.

	\providecommand*{\url}[1]{{\small #1}}
	\providecommand*{\BibUrl}[1]{\url{#1}}
	\providecommand{\BibAnnote}[1]{}
	\providecommand*{\BibEmph}[1]{#1}

By default, gost styles separate logical parts of a bibliography
record by a period and cyrdash (. "---). It is legitimate to drop
that dash by overriding the command \BibDash as follows

	\providecommand*{\BibDash}{}

By default, \BibDash is equivalent to the shorthand "---
introduced by the babel package with the option russian.
It prints a so called cyrillic dash (\cyrdash), which is
20% shorter then ordinary LaTeX dash (---), and puts
unbreakable space before \cyrdash so that dash never appears
in the beginning of a line.
