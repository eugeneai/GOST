GOST is a bundle of BibTeX styles designed to meet State Standards (GOST)
on information, librarianship and publishing issued by Russian Federation
and interstate committee of former USSR States.

It may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the LaTeX
Project Public License, either version 1.3 of this license or (at your
option) any later version. The latest version of this license is in
   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
 version 2005/12/01 or later.

The System of Standards includes:
GOST 7.0.5-2008  Bibliographic reference.
                 General requirements and rules of making.
GOST 7.1  -2003  Bibliographic record.
                 Bibliographic description.
                 General requirements and rules.
GOST 7.80 -2000  Bibliographic record.
                 Heading. General requirements and rules.
GOST 7.11 -2004  Bibliographic description and references.
                 Rules for the abbreviation of words and word combinations
                 in foreign European languages
ect.

The GOST bundle contains 8 BibTeX styles. These include 2 BibTeX styles
for documents in 8bit encoding and 2 equivalent styles in UTF8 encoding.

Encoding        |   Unsorted               Sorted
----------------------------------------------------------------
8bit            |   gost705.bst            gost705s.bst
utf8            |   unicode-gost705.bst    unicode-gost705s.bst

4 styles are retained for backward compatibility. They do not conform
standards listed above.

Encoding        |   Unsorted               Sorted
----------------------------------------------------------------
8bit            |   gost780u.bst           gost780s.bst
utf8            |   unicode-gost780u.bst   unicode-gost780s.bst

To produce 8bit styles, you need to download the files `gost.ins' and
`gost.dtx'. Run LaTeX on gost.ins.  Similarly, to produce unicoded
style, run LaTeX on unicode-gost.ins.

Beyond that, GOST bundle contains CS files (codepage and sorting order).

Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order
----------------------------------------------------------------
cp866           |   ruscii.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
cp1251          |   cp1251.csf          Cyrillic first, Latin
koi8-u          |   koi8u.csf           Cyrillic first, Latin
utf8            |   utf8cyrillic.csf    Cyrillic first, Latin

In addition, BibTeX8 distribution comes with few more CSFs.

Encoding        |   CSF                 Sorting order
----------------------------------------------------------------
cp866           |   cp866rus.csf        Latin first, Cyrillic


How to use

1. Select bibliography style by adding appropriate \bibliographystyle
   declaration to your source file <filename>.tex, e.g.

	\bibliographystyle{gost705}
	\bibliography{dabase}

2. Add the field language="ukrainian" or language="russian" to the
   bibliographic entries in Ukrainian or Russian languages in your
   database; English is the default language. German, Italian and
   French are partially supported.

3. To compile list of references from your database use bibtex8.exe
   rather than bibtex.exe. Depending on the codepage of your
   bibliographic database, indicate one of the CS files
   listed above as option to bibtex8.exe.  Run LaTeX, then run
   bibTeX8 and LaTeX again:

   	latex <filename>.tex
   	bibtex8 -B -c <csf_file>.csf <filename>.aux
	latex <filename>.tex

4. For details on preparing bibliographic database see
   examples in gost*.pdf.

5. Unicode-gost*.bst styles are primarily intended for use
   with unicode compilers (xelatex and lualatex). They
   should be preferred as well when using 8bit compilers
   (latex and pdflatex) if source file is in utf8 encoding.


Customization

Every GOST style defines few commands to format some parts of a
reference. You can redefine these commands prior to
the \bibliography{<bibtex_style>} command. Initial
definitions are listed below.

	\providecommand*{\url}[1]{{\small #1}}
	\providecommand*{\BibUrl}[1]{\url{#1}}
	\providecommand{\BibAnnote}[1]{}
	\providecommand*{\BibEmph}[1]{\emph{#1}}

By default, gost styles separate logical parts of a bibliography
record by a period and cyrdash (. "---). It is legitimate to drop
that dash by overriding the command \BibDash as follows

	\providecommand*{\BibDash}{}

By default, \BibDash is equivalent to the shorthand "---
introduced by the babel package with the option russian.
It prints a so called cyrillic dash (\cyrdash), which is
20% shorter then ordinary LaTeX dash (---), and puts
unbreakable space before \cyrdash so that dash never appears
in the beginning of a line.
